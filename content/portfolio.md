# Regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA)
<div style="text-align: justify">Regularized canonical correlation analyses (rCCA) were performed on all individuals using the regularization of the empirical covariance matrices. This model serves as an integrative multivariate approach to assess correlations between metabolomics, plasma alkaloids, and drug subjective effects. Lambdas were estimated utilizing the Shrinkage method. Next, integrative pathway network and the corresponding clustered heat map were built from the rCCA outputs. Clustered heat map dendrograms were computed from hierarchical cluster analysis, using the Euclidean distance and the complete linkage method.</div><img src="/images/circos_plot.png" /> <img src="/images/heatmap.png" />

# Multi-block PLS: data integration
**N-integration with Projection to Latent Structures model**
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify">Integration of multiple data sets measured on the same observations were carried out utilizing the Nintegration with Projection to Latent Structures model. This model was performed to assess multiblock correlations between sperm quality, sperm function, IVF outcomes, and metabolomic blocks from the same observational units. Pair-wise similarity matrix was obtained from the two correlated latent components obtained through the projection to latent structures method. A relevance network graph was created to describe connections between the four datasets.</div> <img src="/images/multiblockPLS.png" align="right" />

# Multi-omics Factor analysis
**Transforming unsupervised to supervised analyses**
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify">MOFA is a probabilistic factor model that aims to identify principal axes of variation from data sets that can comprise multiple datasets layers and/or groups of samples. Additional time or space information on the samples can be incorporated using the MEFISTO framework.</div> <img src="/images/Planet_plot_blur.png" align="right" />

# Kaplan-Meier survival analysis utilizing metabolic biomarkers
<div style="text-align: justify"> The Kaplan-Meier estimate is the simplest way of computing the survival over time in spite of all these difficulties associated with subjects or situations. For each time interval, survival probability is calculated as the number of subjects surviving divided by the number of patients at risk.</div>
